# Proyecto2.DEV.F
Violencia en MÃ©xico

This project was part of the training for cleaning data. In addtion, I was interested into explore one of the most popular topics in my country "Violence".

On this code were used different functions and methods to explore, cleaning and merge datato have a better understanding and obtain some visualizations of this one. 

The objective of the project was to answers the following questions: 

- Question 1. What is the trend of criminal acts in Mexico over the years?
- Question 2. Does violence have a correlation with the GDP generated by each state?

The conclusions for these questions after cleaning and visualizing the data are the following: 

- Question 1: The crimes committed in Mexico had a positive trend until 2020, some factors that could have affected the change in trend are: the change in policy towards the security of citizens, improvement of the security system in the country or a change in thinking between society resulting in a lower incidence of crime. However, the factor that could be more powerful and the trigger for the change in trend could be the COVID-19 pandemic, because people's mobility was greatly limited, criminals could not find people to harm, so that the number of crimes committed dropped considerably.

- Question 2: There is a correlation between crimes committed per entity and GDP. The larger the GDP, the more crimes are committed.
